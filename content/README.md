# Welcome

This is your content folder. Add markdown files here and they will appear in the reader and editor.

## Getting Started

1. Create `.md` files in this directory
2. Open the **Reader** at `/` to view rendered content
3. Open the **Editor** at `/edit.html` to edit content in-place

## Example Content

Here is a simple example with some formatting:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- `Inline code` and [links](https://example.com)
- Lists, tables, and headings

```javascript
// Code blocks with syntax highlighting
console.log('Hello from the content system!');
```

> Blockquotes work too.

Happy writing!
